COMMENT: I'm just having fun. I couldn't figure out what you were making though, knowing that would help keep me from ruining it. 
:D True
In that case...
1 tb sugar
1 tb spice
1 tb everything nice
OK So we have a summer drink
Traditionally, those three ingredients are supposed to be what girls are made out of. But I prefer your suggestion.
Having said that, we have a drink with chicken in it? We're going to have to work hard on the methods document to make this work.
We have two things here 1) Chicken gravy with my initial ingredients 2) a sweet and sour drink, mostly sought after in summer
